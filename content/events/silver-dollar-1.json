After two exceptional concerts in Athens – the first supporting the well known British pagan Goth rockers INKUBBUS SUKKUBUS – and the recent, very successful appearance in Finland, in “THIS IS GOTHIC FEST”, they decided that time has come to present their music to the dark rock audience of their hometown.\n\nTheir sound cannot be easily categorized, it rests firmly in Goth Rock of the last two decades, while using elements from the world of dark electronica, trip hop and ethnic, always maintaining the special dark aesthetic and unique musicality that characterizes them.
