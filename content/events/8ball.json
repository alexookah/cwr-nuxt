Being a part of a “dark sounds festival”, together with “Split Image” from Athens and “We came From Waters” from Florina, they are about to perform for us the songs from their debut E.P. as well as a lot of brand new songs from their upcoming album. This is a must-see live show for Thessaloniki and we can expect only the best for the 23rd of March. Be there!\n\nEntry: 8 € + beer",
