        <span class="font-semibold">Come with Reverse</span> is a band formed in 2010 in Thessaloniki, Greece. Our band consists of Petros Leivadas (vocals - guitars), Alexander
        Lykesas (drums), Alexander Passalides (keyboard), and Bob Architektonidis (manager). Influenced by a broad spectrum of music genres, our members have a background in
        classical music, extending to traditional-ethnic music from various countries.

      <p class="text-base text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Initially, we embraced an experimental / avant-garde approach, gradually evolving into the darker realms of pop music. This journey influenced our debut album, where we
        ventured beyond the conventional boundaries of pop music in structure, orchestration, and timbre.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Lyrically, we aim to capture the full spectrum of human experience. Looking forward, our ambition is to blend a variety of musical genres in our future projects.
